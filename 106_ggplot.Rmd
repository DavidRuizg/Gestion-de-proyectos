## ggplot2

**ggplot2** is one of the visualization tools that the R system has. The others are the Base R plotting functions and the **lattice** package. ggplot2 is the most evolved and complete plotting

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
